# toying

This repo is where I keep my _miscellaneous_ "projects" (for which I don't want to create a separate repo).

## Licence

The repository is organized as one directory per "project". Each of those "projects" contains their own LICENCE file. If there is no explicit licence, the file/project is licensed under the terms of the MIT licence (see LICENCE for details).
